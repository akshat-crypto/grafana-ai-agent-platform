And also do one more thing, Lets take a scenario , if a user comes in and login and add there kuberentes  cluster, installs the grafana stack, and in that point in time the ai provides you a response and something, it will create the helm chart values, and helm charts do store them in the database at some point in time, in future if the user tries to upgrade that, then it must do the upgrade also there checking the helm chart values and some sort of other details the user might required to upgrade, do create a section for the users where they can check there stacks implemented so far using our dashboard panel 
Pls modify the code, accordingly and then we will do the testing here as well, 

Also one more thing, is there a way that the golang backend code we have written will work continuously like the cursonr agent its creating an answer implements it and then if there is error it creates a new solution something like that, and all these things we can check this on the dashboard on platforms
